function [x, y] = plotDists(Dists,PdfCdf,varargin)   % NEWJEFF: Undocumented
    % Utility function to plot one PDF or CDF for each of several Cupid probability distributions.
    % Dists: a cell array of the probability distributions to be plotted.
    % PdfCdf = 1/2 to plot PDF or CDF
    % Optional arguments:
    %  nPoints: number of x values to compute/plot for each distribution
    %  The remainder of varargin is a list of parameters to be passed
    %  to the plot command for control of line type, thickness, etc.
    %  The first 1/nDists of these parameters are passed when plotting the first distribution,
    %  the next 1/nDists are passed when plotting the 2nd distribution, ...
