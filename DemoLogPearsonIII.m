%% Constructing a complex distribution with a series of transformations.
% As an example of how to construct a complex distribution with a series
% of transformations, this demo shows how to make a _Log-Pearson III_ distribution.
% According to http://daad.wb.tu-harburg.de/?id=522 ,
% the Pearson III distribution is a shifted gamma with shift c,
% and the Log-Pearson III is the exponentiated version of that.
% So, to build this distribution we need the following sequence of steps:
% # Make a gamma distribution.
% # Shift the gamma distribution with an additive constant.
% # Exponentiate the shifted gamma.
%
% Start by making a gamma distribution:

GammaShape = 4;
GammaRate = 20;
startGamma = RNGamma(GammaShape,GammaRate);

%%
% Shift the gamma by adding in a constant. The resulting distribution
% is a Pearson III distribution:
ShiftConst = 2;
PearsonIII = AddTrans(startGamma,ShiftConst);

%%
% According to the same site, the Log-Pearson III
% is a distribution whose log is Pearson III.
% That means that the Log-Pearson III distribution is an
% exponential transformation of the original PearsonIII.
% (Because, taking the log will undo the exponential transform.)
% So, we can make the desired Log-Pearson III by using the Exp transform:

LogPearsonIII = ExpTrans(PearsonIII);
%%
% We are done. The constructed LogPearsonIII is now an example of a Log Pearson III distribution.
%
% Let's see what it looks like (with its current parameters):
LogPearsonIII.PlotDens;

%%
% Here are a few of its properties:
LPIIImean = LogPearsonIII.Mean
LPIIImedian = LogPearsonIII.Median
LPIIIsd = LogPearsonIII.SD

%%
% If we had some data we could estimate the parameters,
% so let's make up some fake data to use for that.
% Normally you would use your own real data.
NDataPoints = 200; 
FakeData = RNGamma(7,1).Random(NDataPoints,1) + 3;  % Just some arbitrary data.

%%
% Now estimate the distribution's parameters 
% (by maximum likelihood) based on the fake data.
% (This may take a minute):
LogPearsonIII.EstML(FakeData)

%%
% Plot the new distribution with the estimated parameters:
LogPearsonIII.PlotDens;

%%
% For comparison purposes, make a histogram of the (fake) data:
figure; histogram(FakeData,'normalization','pdf');
%%
% Presumably, the distribution with the estimated parameters
% should match up pretty well with the histogram.
